        <div class="w3-container">
          <p> I am Julia van Veltum and have spent a lot of time programming since it sparked my interest in the Dutch equivalent of high school.
            I have experience with various programming languages and algorithms and have worked on diverse projects.
            It all began by creating a website using HTML and CSS, which I later expanded with PHP and jQuery.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, I gained hands-on experience implementing classic games like Pong and Tetris. Additionally,
            I had the opportunity to collaborate with six fellow students on a more extensive game project. Together,
            we developed a remake of the iconic NES game BattleCity, introducing new game modes and online multiplayer functionality.
            Although I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I decided to shift my focus and dedicate myself entirely to the field
            of computer science, discontinuing the pursuit of game programming specialization at the end of my first year.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my Bachelor's, most of the elective courses I took were related to AI or algorithms, with the majority being taught in C#.
            I feel proficient in Haskell and functional programming in general. I have experience with more programming languages than just
            the ones listed on the left-hand side. After completing my Bachelor's, I pursued a Master's degree in "Software Engineering"
            at the University of Amsterdam, which I recently finished. During the Master's program, I worked with AWS, became even more
            familiar with SCRUM, and gained insights into requirements engineering and the software development process.

          <p>
            To complete my bachelor's degree, I worked on a project for the GeoScience department at the University of Utrecht.
            This project was undertaken in collaboration with thirteen fellow students, working as a SCRUM team. I dedicated a total
            of 430 hours to this project, which provided me with valuable experience in React and TypeScript. The project involved the
            development of a mobile application, a web application, and a server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective was to create a mobile app that would make geological fieldwork more engaging and interactive.
            It allowed users to create points of interest on a digital map, containing photos and descriptions that could be
            edited and viewed by fellow students. The web application was designed for instructors to mark interesting points in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, I primarily worked on the web application alongside two team members. However, at the beginning of the project,
            I underwent an extensive course on developing an Android app. Given that React is quite barebones,
            I had the opportunity to work with numerous libraries for this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project has been a tremendous learning experience for me.
            I have enhanced my skills in testing and honed my ability to collaborate effectively within a large team setting.
          </p>
          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Master Thesis</b></h5>
          <p>
            My master's thesis focused on "Actionable Test Suite Quality Assessment." I developed a tool that evaluates the quality of a
            Java test suite and provides feedback on potential improvements. The emphasis was on the feedback aspect, as it is often overlooked
            in similar research tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of the research, I examined the correlation between the quality scores generated by my model
            and those produced by another tool that also assesses quality. The results revealed a moderate correlation between the given scores.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout this entire process, I learned to communicate my ideas more effectively, not only in discussions with supervisors but
            also in articulating these ideas and technical concepts in writing. Additionally, I improved my planning skills and became more
            productive in my work.
